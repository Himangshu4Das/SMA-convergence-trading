This is a sample code for a simple trading strategy using two simple moving averages.

NOTE: This code does not represent a reliable trading strategy. This is purely for educational purpose only.
      However you are free to replicate, test and modify the code.
      
      
The code above uses two moving averages with different periods. One has smaller periods and therefore is referred to as fast moving average or shorter moving average.
The other uses a larger period and is relatively slow. When the shorter moving average is greater than the slower moving average we create a long position assuming that
the market has changed the trend. The same is true for exiting the trade.

You can change parameters like intervals of trading period or the periods of the moving averages to achieve different outcomes and accuracy.
